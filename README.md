Forkify: Website for retrieving Recipes

It was a great challenge to complete this project.
I have developed this site by using modern JS concepts which comes under E6/E7.
By doing this project, I have learnt about:


1) Webpack Dev Server
2) Configuring Webpack
3) Babel
4) ES6 Modules
5) Used API to retrieve data
6) Making API Calls
7) Building Controllers
8) Working with LocalStorage


What this side does?
=> Anyone can search about Recipe of dishes like Pizza and Pasta



=> A one can also increases the quantity of ingredients to balance others things out.



=> A one can like the recipe so that it can be stored in Like Section and if he even refreshs the site, the recipe would be there as it was stored in LocalStorage.
